# SniffCheck User Guide

SniffCheck only listens. It never attacks, never sends fake stuff, never pokes other devices. It just watches the air and tells you what it sees.

This guide tells you how to push the button, read the screen, and use the phone page. *<- side note: don't push the button*

## What's new in this build (87.0.111)

- **Evil Twin notifications now tell you *which* network they mean.** Before,
  a twin warning was a single line on one network that said "same SSID +
  mismatched peer" and left you with no way to check it — you couldn't see the
  other network involved, or which check actually tripped. Now every twin
  notification names the peer, links to both networks, and says what fired: an
  open network sharing a protected one's name, an unrelated network with a big
  signal gap, or a mismatched security profile.
- **You can see what argued *against* a warning too.** Each pair lists the
  evidence pointing toward impersonation and the evidence pointing away from it
  (conserved MAC structure, same channel, a recognised public SSID). If the
  evidence can't tell you which of the two is the impostor, it says so instead
  of blaming one.
- **Pairs that were checked and cleared now show up.** Open a Wi-Fi network and
  you'll see the related networks it was compared against and found innocent —
  the usual carrier gateway advertising two service names off one radio, for
  example. Previously a cleared pair looked identical to one that was never
  examined.    *<- this was the actual bug behind a pile of confusing Xfinity
  warnings people were seeing*
- **One relationship = one notification.** Both halves of a pair used to raise
  their own warning, so a single situation read as two or more events. They're
  grouped now, with a count.
- **Boot scan can be turned off.** Settings -> Boot scan. The stick powers up to
  the Main menu and waits instead of scanning immediately. See below.

Previous build (v0.19-phase19-117):

- **The sniffer sweeps in loops now.** Instead of parking on each channel once for a long dwell, the passive sniff hops every `100 ms` and keeps looping over the channel list for the same total time. Devices that only transmit now and then don't get missed just because they were quiet during their channel's one window.
- **The AP comes back after every capture.** Station capture and CSI capture now relaunch the SniffCheck AP on their own when the window ends, same as the packet scan already did. Just reconnect — no more digging through the device menu to re-open it.
- **Quick tabs.** Pick your favorite report tabs in the dashboard Settings (default: Wi-Fi, BLE, Clusters, Channels). The report's floating button is now an apps-grid that jumps straight to them. The theme picker moved to dashboard Settings only — your theme still applies everywhere.
- **Aggregate clusters.** The Clusters tab leads with a new subtab that combines NIC, radio, and privacy clusters describing the same physical device — linked only by a shared hardware address, or a shared SSID *plus* matching vendor OUI. Each tile shows which source clusters were combined and why.
- **RF environment estimate.** The summary now shows a passive read on how busy the air is — crowd density, device density, mobile-device pressure, phone-like clustering — with icons for the device categories that fed the numbers, and a plain caveat that it's an estimate, not a head-count.

Before that (v0.19-phase19-115): theme picker (Dracula/Nord/Gruvbox/Solarized Light/Tokyo Night/Monokai + SniffCheck defaults), public-safety gear badges, privacy-finding clusters, twin radio-cluster dedupe, PSRAM walk tables.

## The button

There is one button: BOOT. You do three things with it:       *<- yes two ":"'s in one sentence...*

- `[1]` = click once
- `[2]` = click twice fast (within `450 ms`)
- `[hold]` = press and hold (about `1.5 seconds`)             *<- sometimes you have to hold it longer..idk*

Rule of thumb: `[hold]` = go back. On scan screens, `[hold]` can also rescan or stop it just depends on what splash you're on...

## Turn it on

1. Plug it in.
2. Logo and the author splash
3. It starts in **Adv mode** (will change this down the road to start in Lite but since this is a demo figured it'd make more sense to show the guts up front)
4. Will always does a scan on boot (we plan to change this, right now though this is what it does..)
5. Loads env summary splash (this will probably stay the same until we add the **ap_on_boot** feature)

On the summary screen:

- `[1]` = Main menu (Results / Settings / Rescan)       *<- pick Results here to look on the dongle before checking out the webpage*
- `[2]` = pup           *<- this is mostly cosmetic atm, so are trophies, we will put a future plans doc in the repo sometime soon*
- `[hold]` = rescan     *<- exactly what it sounds like, BUUUT if you rescan in adv_mode you'll flag the deeper_scan which just means it'll scan for 90s instead of the typical boot scan snapshot. Good for verifying results or digging deeper into some of the threat flags.* 

## Two modes: Lite and Adv

**Adv mode** = the big mode.        *<- Really probably the only reason anyone is checking out this repo* 

All the things:     *<- so if you've read this far you passed the test and pushed a button...you're a real one*

- Deep Wi-Fi and BLE views.
- Drill-down screens (Wi-Fi, BLE, probes, and more).
- The phone page (WebUI).
- Reports, saving, exporting, importing, live capture tools.

Best if you plan to use a phone or laptop.       *<- personally I like to use my laptop and run it in monitor mode, there's a whole set of commands you can run from the monitor that allows you to quickly navigate the firmware and do testing for the sake of testing..*

**Lite mode** = the small mode.     *<- This is what SniffCheck started as. It is what I'll be pushing for the normies, "Hey look a little toy that gives you a simple maybe safe/maybe not safe verdict for the coffee shop you frequent.....yaaaay....actually yes "yay" lite mode is the quick and dirty facts, fast rf audit*

Screen only:

- Quick yes/no read.
- Simple Wi-Fi list.
- Pup.
- No phone needed.

Best if you just want a fast look on the device to see what RF threats flag from a quick snapshot. 

*The device remembers the mode after you change it*

## Change the mode

**On the device, from the Main screen:**          *<- This may change as things progress because right now every flash boots to Adv mode, which gives you easy access to the settings, etc. In Lite mode, it's a little bit of a maze to get to the settings on purpose because originally I planned for Lite to be the only mode, with Adv as an Easter egg for people who want to know more. I digress.*

1. `[1]` = open the Main menu
2. `[1]` to highlight **Settings**, `[2]` to open it
3. `[1]` to highlight the **Mode** row, `[2]` to switch Lite/Adv
4. `[hold]` = back one screen at any point

If the mode changed, it does a fresh boot scan.    *<- not a reboot*

**On the phone page:**

1. Open the phone page (only in Adv mode)
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Pick **Lite** or **Adv**
4. It takes effect on the next scan

## Stop it scanning the moment you plug it in

By default the stick scans as soon as it powers up — that's the whole "plug it
in and read the verdict" idea. But if you're just carrying it around, or it's
sat on a charger, you probably don't want it doing that.

**On the device, from the Main screen:**

1. `[1]` = open the Main menu
2. `[1]` to highlight **Settings**, `[2]` to open it
3. `[1]` to highlight **Boot scan**, `[2]` to flip it ON/OFF

With **Boot scan** off it powers up straight to the Main menu and waits. Nothing
is scanned until you pick **Rescan** yourself. The results screens will say
there's no scan yet, because there isn't one.    *<- this is the same "no scan
yet" you'd see before the first scan finishes normally, not an error*

The setting sticks across reboots. It's on by default, and if you've never
touched it nothing changes.

### Main menu

The Main menu is a `>` selector list: **Results**, **Settings**, **Rescan**.

- `[1]` = next row
- `[2]` = select the highlighted row
- `[hold]` = back to the summary screen

Menus don't show a Back row — `[hold]` is always back, one screen at a time. Results screens have a **Main Menu** row when you want to jump home.

### Lite Results

Results is a `>` selector list now too (Wi-Fi list, Pup, Main Menu):

- `[1]` = next row
- `[2]` = open the highlighted row
- `[hold]` = back

In the Lite Wi-Fi list:

- `[1]` = next network
- `[2]` = open details
- `[hold]` = back to Results

In Lite Wi-Fi details:

- `[1]` = next page
- `[2]` = next network's details
- `[hold]` = back to the list

### Adv Splashes

Adv Results has panes: WiFi, BLE, Probes, Pup

**On the pane picker** (a `>` selector, with a Main Menu row):

- `[1]` = next pane
- `[2]` = open the pane
- `[hold]` = back

**Adv Wi-Fi list:**

- `[1]` = next network
- `[2]` = open details
- `[hold]` = back

**Adv BLE list:**

- `[1]` = next device
- `[2]` = open details
- `[hold]` = BLE Classes

**BLE Classes:**

- `[1]` = next class
- `[2]` = open that class
- `[hold]` = back

**Adv Probes:**

- Open **Probes** to see the Probe Log
- `[2]` = cycle Probe Log > Seq Link > IE Sig > ANQP Leak > back to Probe Log
- `[1]` = look at entries (this is still partially WIP)
- `[hold]` = back to Results

**Explore/Dig:**

- Explore: `[1]` = move cursor, `[2]` = open raw view, `[hold]` = back
- Dig: `[1]` = next frame, `[2]` = previous frame, `[hold]` = back to Explore

## Turn on the phone page (WebAP)

You need to be in Adv mode for this.

From the Main menu:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Highlight the launch-AP row and `[2]` to open it
3. The confirm screen is a `>` selector too:
   - **Start AP** = turn the AP on
   - **Auto-off: N min** = cycle the timer
   - `[hold]` = back

There is also an **Auto AP** setting (Adv only) that launches the phone page automatically after every scan, with no auto-off timer.

When the AP is on:

- The screen shows a QR code to join the SniffCheck Wi-Fi
- After you join, the QR shows the web address
- If nothing opens on its own, enter `192.168.4.1` as a URL in a browser
- Up to 2 devices can join
- `[hold]` = turn the AP off

The AP picks a channel (1, 6, or 11) based on the last scan.

*Lite mode has no phone page.*

## The phone page (WebUI)

It lives on the SniffCheck Wi-Fi. No cloud. No account. No internet needed.    *<- We thought about making an app, but we really want everything to stay on the device as much as possible because we're all cybersecurity-focused and don't really like phone apps. There is a lot of data going back and forth.*

**Open:** `http://192.168.4.1/`

## Tabs

### Home

**Shows status:** AP time left, record count and size, scan count, connected devices, session/firmware info

**Buttons:**

- **View report** = open the live report
- **Save report (.html)** = download a report you can open later
- **Download data (.jsonl)** = download the raw records
- **Keep awake +15 min** = add time to the AP timer
- **Start new scan** = closes the AP (scanning needs the radio). Re-open the AP from the device after
- **Close AP** = turn off the phone page
- **Clear capture** = wipe the current records

### Pup

Virtual Pup. You can: Pet, Give treat, Rename, Start Sniff Walk, Reset Pup    *<- Honestly, all of this is mostly cosmetic, but **walk** right now is a placeholder for some future things we want to do.*

### BYOS

BYOS = bring your own scan. Drop in a file: `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.csv`, `.txt`, or `.log`  *<- We tried to make the 'parse' button work with the common upload types from WiGLE and Kismet, but it's buggy sometimes. We will keep working on it, but it's a low priority at the moment.*

Your browser reads it. You can download a device list or send the records into SniffCheck to view as a report. *<- This is the scaffold for our Dog Park feature that's in the works. More on that later, probably.*

### Settings

- Mode: Lite or Adv (next scan)
- Boot scan: On or Off — read-only here, flip it from the device's own Settings menu
- Theme: palette for the phone page + report (Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized Light, Tokyo Night, Monokai, or the two SniffCheck defaults)
- Quick tabs: choose which report tabs the report's floating apps-grid button jumps to (default: Wi-Fi, BLE, Clusters, Channels)
- Brightness: `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, `100%`
- LED: On or Off      *<- This does not really work. It dims the light, but because we redraw each screen, it initializes an LED flash on redraw for some reason. We have an issue open with Espressif to try to figure this out, but honestly it may come down to the LilyGO T-Dongle C5 not appreciating our attempt at animation.*
- AP timer: `15`, `30`, or `60` minutes    *<- Realistically, you don't need to keep the AP open once you open the summary. Normally I'll launch the AP, connect, go to the page, open **View Report** or save the report as HTML, and then disconnect or do more scans while I check out the results.*

## Reports

From Home, tap **View report** for the live report

Tap **Save report (.html)** to keep a copy for later

**Report tabs:** Summary, Wi-Fi, BLE, Clusters, Trackers, Notifications, Privacy, Channels, Raw, and Drones (if any drones were seen otherwise it won't show up)   *<- clusters are finicky...lot of logic there to combine scanned results and say, with confidence, "yeah this is probably the same router" we're trying to get there but it's taking time*

You can filter and search: by kind, vendor, device type, grade, threat, band, channel. There are quick buttons too: Phones, Cameras, Wearables, Drones, Trackers, Cars, Enterprise APs, Consumer APs, High threat.  *<- we have a smart filter feature that runs but if you're scanning the same areas you'll never really see a difference..also this smart filter feature is part of a future addition*

*a saved report opens later but can't run live tools. Live tools only work on the live report while joined to the SniffCheck AP*

## Scan again from the phone

1. Join the SniffCheck AP
2. Open `http://192.168.4.1/`
3. On Home, tap **Start new scan**
4. The AP closes (the radio is busy scanning)
5. When it's done, open the AP from the device to see new results

## Sniff Walk

A Sniff Walk scans Wi-Fi and BLE while you walk around carrying the device. At the end it saves walk records, gives Pup XP, and opens the AP with a summary.                *<- wardriving but we're calling it Sniff Walk because we want to be trendy and keep to the doggo brand..but we all know what it is*

### Start a walk on the device

1. From the summary, `[2]` = Pup

   **On the Pup page:**
   - `[1]` = play with Pup
   - `[2]` = back
   - `[hold]` = start the walk
2. Carry it while it runs
3. `[hold]` = end the walk
4. Join the AP when the screen shows the join prompt to see the summary

During a walk, clicks do nothing. Only `[hold]` works.

### Start a walk from the phone

1. Turn on the phone page
2. Go to the **Pup** tab
3. Tap **Start Sniff Walk**
4. Tap again if it asks you to confirm
5. The AP closes while you walk
6. End it on the device with `[hold]`
7. The AP comes back on its own with the summary

## Channels tab (live tools)

The Channels tab is in the report. The live buttons only work on the live report while joined to the SniffCheck AP.

**It shows:**

- A bar graph of channel activity from the last scan
- Bars sized against the busiest channel
- 2.4 GHz channels first, then 5 GHz
- A list of stations the device saw active during its scan
**Buttons:** capture stations, CSI, packet scan     *<- this is a work in progress, it works, but we haven't spent a ton of time on it because like a lot of other features this ties into future things we want to do so we've pushed most of it off till we're actually ready to work on it all. for now its ok if you don't know what all this does, feel free to just kinda ignore the channels tab until we flesh this out*

All of these only listen. Nothing is ever sent.    *<- At the moment, this is a global decision for SniffCheck. We're looking at allowing certain things to be possible in Adv mode down the road once we integrate MQTT/Zigbee/Thread, but we haven't crossed that Rubicon yet, so there are things to figure out later.*

### Capture stations

1. Open the live report from the AP
2. Go to **Channels**
3. Tap **Capture stations**
4. Type a channel and a time (`1` to `30` seconds)
5. The AP closes during capture and comes back on its own when the window ends
6. It reads MAC headers only. It does not decrypt traffic
7. Rejoin the AP and reopen Channels to see results

### CSI capture

1. Open the live report from the AP
2. Go to **Channels**
3. Tap **Run CSI capture**
4. Type a channel and a time (`1` to `30` seconds)
5. The AP closes during the window and comes back on its own when it ends
6. You get a GO / NO-GO result
7. Rejoin the AP and reopen Channels to see it

### Packet scan (PCAP)

1. Open the live report from the AP
2. Go to **Channels**
3. Look at the channel graph
4. Tap **Packet scan: 10s per channel**
5. The AP closes while it captures
6. It spends `10 seconds` on each channel in the graph
7. The AP comes back on its own when done
8. Rejoin the AP
9. Go back to Channels and download the PCAP when it's ready

Packet scan only listens. Nothing is sent.    *<- For the moment.*

## If something goes wrong

- Captive portal won't open? Go straight to `http://192.168.4.1/`    *<- save yourself some time, don't set auto connect in device settings for the ap for sniffcheck because it generates a new pass every time, but do save the webpage to your homescreen so you can just skip the second qrcode.*
- Phone page drops during a scan or capture? That's normal. The radio can't serve the AP and scan at the same time *<- if you hit 'Continue trying wifi' it will stay connected*
- After **Start new scan**: re-open the AP from the device *<- should be same password so just rejoining the ap once it shows up works 70% or 90% of the time... we're still trying to figure that one out but I'm sure it'll sneak in there in one of the updates to the repo...*
- After a Sniff Walk, station capture, CSI, or packet scan: the AP comes back on its own *<- see above note*
- Saved reports open later, but live tools need the SniffCheck AP *<- Minus the Channels tab. That's temporary.*
- Lost in the menus? `[hold]` backs you out toward Main
