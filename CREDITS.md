This file lists the projects, datasets, standards, and research that inspired and
motivated SniffCheck. It is part of NOTICE by reference.

I wrote SniffCheck's own code from scratch using AI and ESP-IDF's example code.
The firmware image also bundles two small third-party libraries, both under the 
Apache License 2.0, listed under "Bundled in the firmware" below. 
The web flasher also vendors one MIT library.
Everything else in the lists below gave no source code — those projects are here
because they inspired me, motivated a feature, or are planned interoperability
references.

Note on facts. Lists of facts such as IEEE OUI prefixes, Bluetooth company IDs,
and device name tokens are not copyrightable. Where SniffCheck uses such data it
still names the source that first surfaced it.

## AI use

AI tools were used during prototyping, and to help with debugging and reading
ESP-IDF example code. The design, the decisions, and final code are my own.
